## Purpose:

This folder contains all of my work from the University of Michigan's Applied Machine
Learning with Python course. 

The folder has minimal structure, as it a direct copy of the jupyter notebook directory on Coursera. 

This is done so that when a jupyter notebook is run in this directory, all packages, datasets load correctly.

Assignment files include my solutions. Module and other ipynotebook files include my inquiries, investigations and experiment m ran as additional work, to gain more 
understanidng.
