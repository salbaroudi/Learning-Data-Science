The UofMichigan course explicitly states that they black box methods,
and do not focus on derivations. The course is about usage of algorithms,
instead of "looking in the box".


For certain critical algorithms (read: ones that are very common,
and/or I find interesting), I do go into the mathematical basis 
of how they work; I look inside the box

All derivations are written up in LaTeX, and converted to pdf format.
