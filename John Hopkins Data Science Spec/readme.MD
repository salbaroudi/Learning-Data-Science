This folder contains all of the courses I completed for the John Hopkins 
Data Science Specialization.

This Specialization is mainly coded in R. I chose to stop this Specialization
as learning Data Science with Python seemed more relevent to me. 

This program taught me the following skills:

1) Data Mining

2) Data Munging, Loading and Cleaning.

3) The use of modern Data Munging Packages: such as Tidyverse.

4) Principles of Tidy Data

5) Exploratory Data Analysis.
