Section 2: Tableau Basics: Your first barchart


Sheets, Dashboards, Worksheets





Data Hiearchies

Calculated Columns

Loading Data:
   - Joins and Unions


- Autofetching Data: If you load location or GPS data, Tableau will automatically load a world map
for geospatial plotting.
- if you drag region names into the main chart space, Tableau wil just load a map automatically. You can also 
right click on a dimension and give tableau context, if it doesn't interpret it correctly, by selecting "Geographic Role"


Aggregated Field

Interactivity of Dashboards
This is done by setting up actions, events that link entities together and do something. Do this from the Dashboard
Menubar.


Joining vs Blending:
- Joining is the same as with SQL.
- joins work at row level only!
- Blending is a new concept!
- Blending used when level of granularity of the tables does not match. Need to Group and Aggregate.

Adding Data: In the Data Source Window, there are two methods:
1) Changing your data Source: This opens up a new tableau workspace.
	Note: All your old visualizations will still be connected to the old data. Do this when
 	you want to start something new.
2 Adding a new data Source: this imports data into your current workspace.


Blending:
- is a left join.
- blends are used when datasources have different levels of granularity, or different systems.
-occurs after aggregation (you need to drag things into the chart)
- occurs between two different Data Sources.
- Will match granularity before performing the join.
- Is done on a per-sheet basis.
- If fields have the same name across datasets, tableau will automatically join them.
    - these show up in the relationships box of the Data Menu

VS Joins:
- Join done at the data load pane, not on the sheets.
- You can't do group aggregate quieries at the data pane, so you have to do a blend afterwards.

- Dual axis charts 
- When you have two charts stacked (in terms of rows), that share units. You can superimpose them
on one another. Remember to syncrhonize axes to normalize the two charts.

- Calculated Fields in a Blend:
   - inputs that you put in will be aggregated; can't do on single values.


Table Calculations: 
- Allows for simple transformation of labels on a chart. For example, totals-> percentages, or calculating
a simple statistic.

Creating Bins and Distributions for Age:
- this involves transforming a Measure into a Dimension. You create a bin, and set its width. 
- just like Measures, you can do a table calculation and transform labels on the chart.

Parameters: are set in the context of charts to control them dynamically.
To set a parameter, right click on the Data Measures Area
Parameters can be attached to derived quantities (like bins) as well.

- Simple Interconnectivity:
Right click on a subchart in a dashboard, and make it a Filter. It will take a subset of data for all the 
other charts in the dashboard. 

Remember that filters are just a type of action.

Data Tidying and Filling in is done with the Data Interpreter 
- issues:
- subheaders, hidden columns (excel), non-standard formatting, non-tidy data.
- The Data Interpreter Issues a report, that shows which columns were interpreted as headers,data and blank.
	- This tells you how to clean up the data in excel, before passing it back in.
- It also crushes sets of null columns (hidden).

- in the data viewer, there are two views:
Metadata
Regular data

Transform Operations: In the data viewing area of the Data Source Tab, you can click on column headers and perform
a number of operations, or transformations, such as:

Pivoting: what they really mean is data melting here. Turning Data into Wide -> Tall format.
Splitting: Apply the string split() function to separate out composite data from rows.


Fixing Common Geographical Mistakes:
- When data is loaded, Null/error values will be indicated. You can filter them out, or edit them.
- often times, misspellings, or non-US names are being used. You can just change it so tableau understands.



Whats New in Tableau 10:

Three new Featurs:
1) Build your own Territories
   Method 1: Make Groups via manual highlighting on map:
   - To do this, select areas on the map (with CTRL button), and then right click and group them together.
   - you can group on single or composite properties.
   - Note: You might have to remove region/state data for the territories to show up.
   - You can calculate statistics based on these composite groups.
   Method 2: Custom Territories via Geographic Roles
   - If you already have region groupings identified by a column, you can just use Geo Roles.
   - this associates group names to elements, in the data.
   - Tableau will put your group column into a spatial data hiearchy, drag and drop the new field into the map to
   get your territories.


Highlighting:
- Subtly highlight different marks on your chart based on categories within the selectd field without interfering with the 
charts visual representation (mark size, colors, etc).
- Use this when you have too many properties dependent on the color feature.
- Drag Dimension onto Detail, and select Highlighter from the dropdown menu.
Clustering:
- 


2) Clustering! Tableau can basically identify groups based on various properties. Basic Unsupervised learning.
- this is done with the Analytics Tab in the workspace.
- Drag Cluster algorithm into color mark property, for an effective visualization.
- to add properties to the clustering, just edit the cluster, and drag quantities or dimensions into it.
- to save the cluster, drag it into the Dimensions Area.

Regression (Trend Lines):
Select and drag onto clusters, from the Analytics Plane.

3) Cross Database Joins! 
In the past, joins on separate databases and files was impossible (silo'ed). You could only do a data blend.
Now, you can join files, databases, whatever!

Other Improvements:
- Default Colour pallete for T10 is more harmonized, softer pastels, and takes into account people with colour blindness.
- Device Preview: When you build Dashboards, you can simulate different tablets and phones to ensure they fit your 
customer's devices.


Questions:
- What is the difference between a Quick Calculation and a Table Calculation?
